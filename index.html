        The general populace are becoming more concerned with the idea that more and more services, especially those involved in
        entertainment, are becoming more subscription bas
        You can own your entertainment, even if it is digital. There are a subset of media consumers who are switching to
        analog forms of entertainment like vinyl and blu-ray. I respect their intentions, but as an aspiring computer nerd, 
        I dont't think it necessary. If it is on the internet (TV shows, Movies, Video games, Music, Books, Education)
        you can own it. Sometimes this will require some engineering, for example setting up or creating an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulator</a> to allow you to play video games that are 
        supposed to be locked behind a monthly paywall (cough nintendo cough). Invest in storage devices, 
        load the storage devices up with massive amounts of pirated content, boom, you own it.

    <h3 id="caution">CAUTION</h3>
    <p> 
        You must be wary of malactors. If you buy drugs from a pharmacy and they rip you off, there are legitmate authorities who
        can help you with that. If you buy drugs from a shady guy in an alley and he rips you off, you are on your own, the principle
        stands when downloading pirated content. KNOW YOUR SOURCES, trust your providers, enable anti-virus, anti-malware,
        keep external backups of important information and encrypt sensitive information. Basic but pertinent.
